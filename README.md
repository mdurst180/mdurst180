### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have been a technical co-founder, CTO & full stack engineer within both large companies and startups. Iâ€™m hands on, I love solving problems and I love building technology. I have experience working in the healthcare, financial & energy industries.

I love to solve problems & can get in the weeds. I want to understand how things work and ask questions. I love to face tough problems, think about architecture, systems, and write code. I love to bring products to life and see them out in the real world. I can pick up new languages and codebases relatively quickly. Iâ€™m pretty adept at being pragmatic and making reasonable decisions.

Within teams, I work hard to build trust from those around me through reliability, credibility, vulnerability and authenticity. I love to build teams, mentor & grow. There has been a nice cyclical flow in my career as I move from engineer to leader and back again. I really enjoy that cycle and Iâ€™ve been fortunate to work with really smart teams in both capacities.
