### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have been a technical co-founder, CTO & Full Stack Engineer within both large companies and startups. Iâ€™m hands on, I love solving problems and I love building technology.

I love to understand how things work and ask questions. I love to face tough problems, think about design, architecture, systems, and write code. I love to bring products to life and see them out in the real world. 

I can pick up new languages and codebases relatively quickly. Iâ€™m pretty adept at being pragmatic and making reasonable decisions.

Within teams, I work hard to build trust from those around me through reliability, credibility, vulnerability and authenticity. I love to build teams, mentor & grow.
